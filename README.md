# Developer Init
Everytime I get a new computer, it takes me a couple hours to get everything set up. This package presents setup scripts to help developers get started with a new computer installing common applications and developer tools. Some of the installation is opinionated with the setup tools that I prefer, but it is straightforward to customize to your liking.
